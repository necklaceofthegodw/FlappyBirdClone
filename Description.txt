Hello,

To run the project open the .sln file in Visual Studio ( I used Visual Studio 2019 ) and choose x86 Debug configuration
All the SDL libraries are already included in the project.

I completed all the main tasks:
* The game doesn’t compile out of the box.
* Points stop adding up after the first obstacle.
* For some reason, the bird flies straight through the floor. That’s not ideal.
* The bird animation is choppy and not smooth.
* Pipes mysteriously disappear after a while.
* Unlike the original, the bird doesn’t rotate when it moves.

And as an additional feature request I chose:
* Varied Pipe Spacing – Right now all pipes are evenly spaced on the X-axis. That’s boring. Let’s spice it up with some randomness.
